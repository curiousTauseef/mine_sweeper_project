Mine sweeper source code in C.
Including features...
0. Playtime display
1. Mine 'markmode'. When you mark as many as mines, the rest is automatically opens for you.
2. 'testrun' mode, make hidden board visible. Enables you to quickly test functions and see how this game work.
3. Difficulty selection(hard : 15X15, 25 mines, normal : 10X10, 10 mines)
4. When you opened a field with number '0', automatically opens its north, south, west, east field as well
5. No global variables. Only constant is "MAX", but easily replaceable.
   But actually used struct board as almost like a global variable because it is invoked from almost every function.
6. When you win or lose, it will politely(?) ask if you want to play it again.
7. When you win, the ending shows your progress. When you lose, the ending shows your progress,
   where you were hit(by 'X'), how it looks like when you win, and the original hidden board.
8. It took so much time to make it, but I really enjoyed making it and learned a lot from it.
9. Now, please enjoy the game! Play!
